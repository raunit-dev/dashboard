# Dashboard

A modern, full-stack dashboard application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. This project demonstrates advanced React patterns, server-side data fetching, UI skeletons for loading states, and integration with a PostgreSQL database for managing customers, invoices, and revenue data. The dashboard is styled with Tailwind CSS and leverages a component-driven architecture.
